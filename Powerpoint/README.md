Here are just a few of the works I created in Powerpoint.

## Voice of the Customer

This is a report I worked on monthly that helped us visualize what the customers think of the business and expectations they have for the products and services. Survey feedback and Quality Monitoring data makes up the slides. 

Here are a few examples, there are more screenshots available in the **Voice of the Customer** directory.

## Executive Dashboard

This was also a monthly report I would work on that shows Efficiency and Quality Metrics for each subsidiary as well as combined. I would also break down Service Level by Queue as well as performance by location.

Here are a few examples, there are more screenshots available in the **Executive Dashboard** directory.

## Call Center Marketing Material

This presentation was used to promote services our CX Solution provided to businesses in the hopes they would use our Outsourced Call Center for their support.

Here are a few examples, there are more screenshots available in the **Call Center Marketing Material** directory.
