## Reps Needed Calculation

Using the Erlang C formula this calculator allowed us to input a variety of variables and calculate how many Reps were needed to assist customers. Some inputs are **Subscribers**, **Call in Rate %**, **Wait Time**, **Service Level Target**, **Occupancy**, **Shrinkage**, **AHT**, **Hours of Operation** and **Shift Length**.

## Scorecard Calculation

The Scorecard Calculation measures individual reps performance as well as a team. The KPI's used are **Rep Overall Satisfaction**, **Average Handle Time (AHT)**, **Quality Score** and **Policy Score**. The results are then measured against a range to provide a score for that KPI. Lastly, the scores are added up, and we're provided an Overall Score for the Rep/Team
