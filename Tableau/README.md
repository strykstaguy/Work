# Tableau

Here are just a few of the works I created in Tableau.

## Call Center Dashboard

The purpose of the Call Center Dashboard is to summarize the Call Center performance. The main use is to view the previous day but you can change the date range and view the performance by Yesterday, Current Week, Last Week and Current Month. You can view a demo [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cody.benner/viz/CallCenterDashboard_17004167955470/Dashboard)

## Call Center Outbound Campaign

The Call Center Outbound Campaign Dashboard allows you to view all campaigns or a specific one. You can see at the top how many customers were contacted and how many remain. Next you can view the Dispositions percentage followed by the Agents and the percentage handled. Lastly you can view all items in the campaign, paginated and easy to read.
